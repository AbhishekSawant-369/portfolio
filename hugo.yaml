     I'm Abhishek Sawant — a curious and creative product designer with a foundation in engineering, user experience design, and 3D printing.

     Over the years, I’ve worked in diverse roles — from building CAD models and managing 3D workflows to creating wireframes and prototypes for mobile applications. My unique blend of technical knowledge and design thinking helps me turn complex challenges into clean, intuitive user experiences.

     I’ve worked with Slack as a volunteer designer, produced content for Internshala, and run my own counseling franchise. With tools like Figma, SolidWorks, and CURA, I enjoy creating end-to-end solutions that blend usability with innovation.

     I believe in continuous learning and love sharing knowledge through content, workshops, and collaboration.
