### Project Overview

This is a minimalist mobile calculator UI I designed to explore space distribution, color contrast, and simplicity. Inspired by system apps but focused on readability and touch ergonomics.

### Tools Used

- Figma
- Google Fonts
- Contrast Checker

### My Focus

- Clean grid layout
- Button state interaction
- Dark mode testing

### Learnings

Even small utilitites like a calculator benefit from strong visual hierarchy and consistent feedback design.
