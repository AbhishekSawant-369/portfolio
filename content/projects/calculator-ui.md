I would like to share my thoughts on designing this calculator UI.

### <i class="fas fa-search"></i> Research & Observation

To begin, I explored various calculator UI designs through Google image searches and also studied the calculators on some of my friends' phones. My aim was to get an understanding of what's trending - both in terms of layout and usability.

### <i class="fas fa-edit"></i> Key Design Goals

- Keep it **simple**, but not completely black and white - some subtle color should add character.
- The design should feel **familiar**, similar to most native calculator apps.
- The **keypad** should occupy **50-60%** of the screen - within natural thumb reach.

### <i class="fas fa-pencil"></i> Sketching the UI

I started sketching ideas on paper. One of the unique aspects I wanted to experiment with was using **horizontal lines between numbers**, inspired by math notebooks. But to keep it clean, I didn't let the lines run edge to edge — this added structure without making the UI feel boxed in.

For switching to scientific mode, instead of using a bulky icon, I chose a minimalist “Sci” label — familiar and space-saving.

### <i class="fas fa-hand-point-down"></i> Thumb Reach Consideration

Since calculators are mostly used with **one hand or both thumbs**, I tested different screen zones for optimal touch access. I validated this by comparing with my own phone usage. The ideal range for easy thumb access turned out to be the **central 50–60%** of the screen — anything too high or too low was uncomfortable.

### <i class="fas fa-palette"></i> UI Design in Figma

With the concept ready, I jumped into Figma to bring it to life.

- I experimented with **color schemes**, eventually choosing the **darkest tone** of the highlight color I introduced.
- To create both **light and dark modes**, I used [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co) — an awesome tool for generating color palettes and checking color contrast.

### <i class="fas fa-mobile-screen"></i> Mockups & Final Touches

Once the design was finalized, I used the **Artboard Studio Mockups plugin** in Figma to generate presentation visuals. It helped showcase the UI in a real-world context and bring out the minimal design vibe.

### <i class="fas fa-bullseye"></i> Final Thoughts

This was a small project, but one that helped me pay attention to **usability, simplicity, and visual hierarchy**. Designing a calculator — something so common — turned out to be a great exercise in constraint-driven design.
