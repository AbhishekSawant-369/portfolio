### Project Overview

This redesign focuses on improving the user journey while uploading a WhatsApp status. I rethought the interface to feel more intuitive, especially around image previews and captioning.

### Key Improvements

- Large, tappable image preview
- One-tap access to filters and stickers
- Better visibility of 'Send to' and 'Audience' options

### Learnings

Even small UI changes can lead to a much smoother experience. Designing for an already-used interface made me consider edge cases and consistency deeply.
