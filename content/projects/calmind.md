# Calmind - A Mood & Wellness App

---

## What is Calmind?

Calmind is a soft, private space to reflect on how you feel - one moment at a time.
With no unnecessary complexity or overwhemling flows, it helps users log their mood, optionally journal, and receive gentle affirmations - all in under 2 minutes.

---

## The Problem

Most wellness apps are complicated and ask too much. Users just want something that listens - not judges.
