For the long time, I believed I needed the best tools to get started - a MacBook, an iPhone, a perfect setup. But now I have realized what I truly need is consistency, honesty, and action.

I'm starting my journey as a product designer and creator with an old laptop, an average phone, and full clarity. This blog is my open journal. I'll share everything I learn about UI/UX, personal growth, money making, and content creation.

A while ago, I worked at a 3D prototyping startup. I got hands-on experience in creating 3D models and printing them. But it still felt like something was missing. I wasn't building a life aligned with my vision.

So I hit pause. I stopped chasing shiny things and started digging deeper - into myself, my skills, my purpose.

Now, I'm starting from zero - but with a different mindset.

Not with fear, but with hunger.

Not with pressure, but with presence.

Not with perfection, but with persistence.

This blog isn't just for me - it's for anyone who feels like they're behind. For anyone trying to build something out of nothing. For anyone who's tired of waiting to feel "ready".

I don't have it all figured out. But I'm here - showing up, learning in public, growing brick by brick.

Let's begin. <i class="fas fa-rocket"></i>
