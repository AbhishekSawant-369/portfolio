For the longest time, I believed I needed the best tools to get started - a new MacBook, an iPhone, a perfect setup. But now I have realized what I truly need is consistency, honesty, and action.

I'm starting my journey as a product designer and creator with an old laptop, an average phone, and full clarity. This blog is my open journal. I'll share everything I learn about UI/UX, personal growth, money making, and content creation.

This isn't just for me - it's for anyone who feels like they're behind.
If I can build from here, so can you.

Let's begin.
